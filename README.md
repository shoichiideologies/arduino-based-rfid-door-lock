Arduino-Based Door Lock System

This project is an Arduino-powered electronic door lock system that uses an RFID sensor for access control 
and an LCD display for status monitoring. When a user taps a registered RFID card, the system verifies 
the unique ID and either grants or denies access. If access is granted, a relay activates to unlock the door for a brief duration. 
The LCD provides real-time feedback such as “Access Granted” or “Access Denied” to the user. 
This system is ideal for basic home or office security applications and demonstrates the integration of microcontroller-based automation with user-friendly output displays.
